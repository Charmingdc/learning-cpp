# CppFundamentals: Core Concepts and Practical Lessons 💻

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive foundation for mastering C++. It contains a curated set of lessons ranging from basic syntax and standard I/O to low-level ASCII operations and conditional logic. Designed with clarity in mind, these modules demonstrate how to leverage the C++ Standard Library for efficient problem-solving and memory management.

## Features
- **Low-Level Operations**: Practical implementation of ASCII value manipulation and arithmetic.
- **Data Integrity**: Deep dive into primitive data types, memory sizes (sizeof), and type modifiers.
- **Control Flow**: Robust examples of conditional statements and logical branching.
- **Stream I/O**: Implementation of standard input/output streams and escape sequences for console formatting.
- **String Handling**: Usage of `getline` and string manipulation for interactive CLI applications.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the development environment on your local machine.

- **Clone the Repository**
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Charmingdc/learning-cpp
  cd learning-cpp
  ```

- **Prerequisites**
  Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (GCC or Clang).
  - For Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install build-essential`
  - For macOS: `xcode-select --install`

- **Build Instructions**
  Navigate to the `lessons` directory and compile any file using `g++`:
  ```bash
  g++ lessons/hello-world.cpp -o hello_world
  ```

## Usage
Each file in this project is an independent lesson. To run a specific module, compile it and execute the generated binary.

### Example: Running the ASCII Value Lesson
1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   g++ lessons/ascii-value.cpp -o ascii_test
   ```
2. **Execute**:
   ```bash
   ./ascii_test
   ```
3. **Interact**: Follow the CLI prompts to see how C++ handles character-to-integer conversions and arithmetic.

### Example: Checking Conditional Logic
1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   g++ lessons/conditional-statements.cpp -o logic_test
   ```
2. **Execute**:
   ```bash
   ./logic_test
   ```
