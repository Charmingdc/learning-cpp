# C Programming Foundations 💻

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of fundamental C programming scripts designed to demonstrate core concepts of the language. It serves as a practical reference for understanding syntax, data types, format specifiers, and variable management in C.

## Features
- **Core Syntax**: Basic structure of a C program including headers and main functions.
- **Data Formatting**: Implementation of various placeholders for integers, floats, characters, and strings.
- **Variable Management**: Practical usage of arrays and character strings to store and display information.
- **Clean Code**: Well-structured examples that are easy to compile and study.

## Installation
To get these scripts running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Install a Compiler**:
    Ensure you have a C compiler installed (like `gcc`). If you're on Linux or macOS, you likely already have it. On Windows, you can use MinGW or WSL.

3.  **Navigate to the Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd <project-folder-name>/lessons
    ```

## Usage
Each file in the `lessons/` directory is a standalone program. To run them, you need to compile the source code first.

### Hello World
The classic entry point for any programmer.
```bash
gcc hello-world.c -o hello
./hello
```

### Inputs and Placeholders
Learn how C handles different data types using format specifiers like `%d`, `%lf`, and `%s`.
```bash
gcc inputs-placeholders.c -o placeholders
./placeholders
```

### Working with Variables
See how to declare strings and integers to create dynamic output.
```bash
gcc variables.c -o variables
./variables
```
