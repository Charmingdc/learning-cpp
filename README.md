# CPP Fundamentals 🖥️

## Overview
This repository serves as a foundational collection of C++ programming lessons, designed to bridge the gap between theoretical syntax and practical application. It covers core concepts including standard output streams, data types, and arithmetic logic through clean, executable scripts.

## Features
- **Standard I/O Operations**: Clear examples of using the `iostream` library for console communication.
- **Variable Management**: Practical implementation of integer declarations and data storage.
- **Arithmetic Logic**: Demonstration of mathematical operators and modular arithmetic.
- **Clean Syntax**: Follows modern C++ conventions for readability and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install a Compiler**:
   Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++` or `clang`).
   - On Linux/macOS: `sudo apt install g++` or use Xcode tools.
   - On Windows: Install MinGW or use Visual Studio.

### Compiling the Lessons
Navigate to the project directory and compile individual files using the following commands:

- **Hello World**:
  ```bash
  g++ lessons/hello-world.cpp -o hello
  ```

- **Outputs & Logic**:
  ```bash
  g++ lessons/outputs.cpp -o outputs
  ```

## Usage
Once compiled, you can run the executable binaries directly from your terminal to see the logic in action.

### Running Hello World
```bash
./hello
```
*Output:* `Hello World from C++`

### Running Outputs & Logic
```bash
./outputs
```
*Output:* 
- A string detailing student information with dynamic variable insertion.
- The result of a modulo operation (5 % 2).
